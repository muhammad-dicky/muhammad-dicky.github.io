            <h3>Project information</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Category</strong>: Web Design</li>
              <li><strong>Project date</strong>: 01 September, 2021</li>
              <li><strong>Project URL</strong>: <a
                  href="https://dribbble.com/shots/16371792-Medical-Webapp">Dribble.com</a></li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              This is webapp design for hospital management. Doctor and hospital authority can use this webapp to
              maintain their daily activities.
              <br>
              Here is now the profile of Doctor. So this dashboard now showing the daily activity of doctor. When any
              hospital or clinic authority will log in to this webapp then it will show the whole activity of a
              hospital, medical or clinic.
              <br>
              From this dashboard a doctor will able to maintain his daily activity. Such as:
              Firstly, a doctor can get the overview of his incoming patient history filtering Yearly ,Monthly, Weekly
              and Daily.
              <br>
              A doctor will able able to know here how many new patient now, how many injects and surgery patients. Who
              are in reviews and who are in progress.
              <br>
              Similarly a doctor can know his booking rate and specially his patient booking increase or decrease rate .
              <br>
              We know that, special doctor has chamber in many hospital some cases in many country too. So from this
              dashboard a doctor can schedule his activity in dashboard calendar. Which will help a doctor to do his
              duty properly.
              <br>
              During his consultancy, a doctor will able to track his income and expense.
              <br>
              From this appointment section , a doctor can show patient ongoing health history and based on it he can
              provide proper health consultation and medicine.
              <br>
              I have chosen those colour to make this web app desirable and useful too. Using this web app users wont
              feel bore and it wont distract users from their goal.
              <br>
              I have added a illustration characters wearing masks as a gentle reminder to wear your mask because of the
              global Covid pandemic.
              <br>
              The challenge was to keep all important data on this web application to make it user centric and make its
              interface modern, desirable and useful too.
